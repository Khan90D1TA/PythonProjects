# Machine Learning: Exploring the Sigmoid Function

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where I delve into the intricacies of the sigmoid function, a crucial component in machine learning and artificial neural networks.

## Notebook Content

The notebook is structured into different parts, each addressing specific aspects of the sigmoid function:

1. The properties of the sigmoid function, including its output range and why it can't equal 0 or 1.
2. Additional insights and discussions about the sigmoid function within the context of machine learning and neural networks.

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, you will need Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install it via Anaconda or as a standalone package. Once installed, clone this repository, navigate to its location on your machine via command line (or Anaconda prompt), and type `jupyter notebook`. This will open a browser window from where you can open the notebook and run it.
